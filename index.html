    <h3>What is HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for <i>H</i>yper<i>T</i>ext <i>M</i>arkup <i>L</i>aguage.
        It's a markup language that web developers use to structure ans describe the content of a webpage (not a programmig language).</p>
<p>HTML consist of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links,
    heading, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>

    <ol> 
        <li>The Opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag </li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
