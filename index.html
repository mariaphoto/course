 <p>All modern websites and applicaions are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and
    JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>
<p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML, is all about,
    and why you too should learn it.</p>
    <h3>What is HTML</h3>
    <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>aguage.
        It's a markup language that web developers use to structure ans describe the content of a webpage (not a programmig language).</p>
<p>HTML consist of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links,
    heading, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
    <p> In HTML each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol> 
        <li>The Opening tag</li>
        <li>The closing tag </li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
